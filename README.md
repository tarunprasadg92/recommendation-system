# recommendation-system

The goal was to build a simple book recommendation system. The dataset contains a database of books and users, with users rating books they have read. Using this information and applying various distance measure techniques, we classify users, and try to predict a new book the user has not read based on his reading preferences.
Methods used:
- Minkowski Metric (for computing both Manhattan and Euclidean distances)
- Pearson Correlation Coefficient
- Cosine Similarity
- K-Nearest Neighbor
